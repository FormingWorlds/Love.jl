## Poro-viscoelastic tidal heating of Io

This example reproduces all figures in the manuscript _Poro-viscoelastic tidal heating of Io_, by Hay, Hewitt, Rovira-Navarro, and Katz.

<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

Figures will be created by running `PoroviscoelasticTides.ipynb` in your favourite Jupyter notebook environment. 

If this is your first time running Julia in a Jupyter environment, you need to add the Julia kernal to Jupyter. Do this by first starting the Julia REPL with `julia`, then
   ```sh
   julia> ]
   pkg> add IJulia
   ```

In the `PoroviscoelasticTides` directory, begin a Jupyter server 
   ```sh
   jupyter notebook PoroviscoelasticTides.ipynb
   ```
or 
   ```sh
   jupyter execute PoroviscoelasticTides.ipynb
   ```
Alternatively, use VisualStudio Code
   ```sh
   code PoroviscoelasticTides.ipynb
   ```
